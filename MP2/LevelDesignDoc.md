The Main_level has 3 levels and the difficulty is supposedly following a increasing curve. The first one is quite vast, made of two large islands. 

To the left of the player, it's a "testing field" having one of each type of actors in the whole game, allowing the player to explore the mechanics of the game with ease. To the right is the main part of level1 is a slight mixture of all 3 enemies, along with excessive coins and medkit. Goal is to let the player learn about navigating through hordes that are rather easy.

Level 2 is a enclosed space of landmine maze, where coins and medkits are scatter in the tiny maze, encouraging players to explore around in exchange for the high risk high reward(well.....). 

Level 3 is the ultimate horde of all enemy types, and chasers have bigger vision cone so the point is to allow  multiple chasers to push the player through the mortars and landmines.

After level 3, it's a gentle glide to the final island where only coins and parks are present, showing the finish line.
